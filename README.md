RMC Project 2 – Forward Dynamics of a 3R Planar Manipulator (MATLAB)

Author: Sarthak Dubey

Instructor: Prof. Devin Teran

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation for my final project in ME 5250.
The goal is to simulate the forward dynamics of a 3R planar robot falling under gravity, following the modeling approach presented in Section 8.5 of Modern Robotics by Lynch & Park.

The simulation computes:

Configuration-dependent mass matrix

Gravity torque vector

Joint accelerations using forward dynamics

Joint-angle time evolution using Euler integration

End-effector trajectory

A simple animation of the falling arm

All results shown in the project report were generated using this code.
